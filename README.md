This project is a simple PCB based Christmas ornament with blinky LEDs and rechargeable supercaps.

### Hardware
#### Schematic
#### Layout
To keep this project cheap, the goal is to fit the whole layout on a 10x10cm 2 layer board, which JLCPCB famously offers at 2$ for 5pcs. Decision was made to split the tree in 2 halves that would then be soldered back together. For the 1st time I experimented with using the different layers (bare FR4 material, bare copper, copper+soldermask, bare soldermask and silkscreen) to make a somewhat artistic result. For more info on the colors you can get playing with PCBs I would recommend visiting [this page]{https://github.com/Hanqaqa/PCB_Color_Palette}
- Leds reverse mounted so they shine through the board: solder mask keepout areas are placed on both sides to let the light through.
- Base of the tree doubles as a USB A port to easily recharge the batteries

#### Ordering
Zipped gerbers are available to be directly dropped on manufacturers websites like JLCPCB. I used their excellent prototype service
