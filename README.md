# PCB_Christmas_Tree
This project is a simple PCB based Christmas ornament with blinky LEDs and rechargeable supercaps.

### Hardware
#### Schematic
#### Layout
To keep this project cheap, the goal is to fit the whole layout on a 10x10cm 2 layer board, which JLCPCB famously offers at 2$ for 5pcs. Decision was made to split the tree in 2 halves that would then be soldered back together.
- Leds reverse mounted so they shine through the board: solder mask keepout areas are placed on both sides to let the light through.
